// Package addons is the machinery the app's two extension points share: how a
// user's own files are found, how far into their folders we are willing to
// look, what happens when one of them will not parse, and how what loaded is
// merged over what ships with the app.
//
// Themes and solution plugins are different things with different schemas, but
// they are installed the same way and have to behave the same way when
// something is wrong -- one bad file never costs the user the files either side
// of it, and a file that fails is always named with a reason rather than
// silently missing. That behaviour is here, once, rather than in two loaders
// that would drift the first time either was fixed.
//
// Nothing in this package knows what a theme or a plugin is. It finds files and
// hands their bytes to a callback.
