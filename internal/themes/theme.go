// Package themes is the app's palette engine: the built-in themes, the format a
// third party writes one in, and the loader that reads them off disk.
//
// A theme is a set of design tokens and nothing else. It cannot ship CSS, run
// code, or reach any part of the app but its colours -- which is what makes
// dropping a stranger's theme file into a folder a reasonable thing to do. The
// cost of that is that a theme can only recolour what the app already draws;
// the benefit is that a bad theme is ugly rather than broken.
//
// The built-in themes are embedded JSON in exactly the format a user's own
// theme takes, rather than Go structs. That is deliberate: there is one parser,
// one validator and one shape to document, and every built-in doubles as a
// worked example someone can copy as a starting point.
