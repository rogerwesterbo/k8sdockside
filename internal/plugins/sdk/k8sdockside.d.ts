/*
 * k8sdockside.d.ts -- types for the K8s Dockside plugin bridge.
 *
 * Describes the bridge of K8s Dockside >= 0.0.15 (protocol
 * "k8sdockside/plugin@1"): the `window.k8sdockside` object a plugin's own
 * pages get from
 *
 *     <script src="/plugin-ui/_sdk/k8sdockside.js"></script>
 *
 * The copy kept in step with the bridge is the one beside it in the K8s
 * Dockside repository, internal/plugins/sdk/k8sdockside.d.ts. It is
 * self-contained on purpose -- no imports, no exports, only global
 * declarations -- so the file can be copied as it is into any plugin written
 * in TypeScript. Put it where your tsconfig's "include" sees it (or
 * `/// <reference path="k8sdockside.d.ts" />` it) and both `k8sdockside` and
 * `window.k8sdockside` are typed everywhere.
 *
 * How the bridge works, in short: every call posts a message to the app, which
 * answers it -- or rejects the promise with an Error carrying a sentence --
 * from outside the page's sandboxed frame. The app answers only for kinds the
 * plugin declares (its `requires`, `views`, `cards`, `sections`, `actions`
 * and `ui.kinds`) and never for Secrets. Everything that comes back has been
 * through JSON: plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans and null.
 * A patch or an action is shown to the user in a dialog the page cannot
 * reach, and happens only if they say yes.
 *
 * The page itself has no network: fetch, XHR and websockets are refused by
 * its Content-Security-Policy, and it must be a classic script, not
 * `type="module"`.
