// A plugin's own views are HTML and script from a folder beside its file. They
// are served by the app's asset server under UIPath and drawn in an iframe
// sandboxed without allow-same-origin, which gives them an opaque origin: they
// cannot reach the app's DOM, its storage, or -- through the guard below -- its
// services. Everything they learn about the cluster they ask for over
// postMessage, and the frame that hosts them (PluginFrame.svelte) answers only
// for the kinds the plugin declares.
//
// The protections are layered because none of them is enough alone:
//
//   - the iframe's sandbox attribute gives the frame an opaque origin;
//   - the Content-Security-Policy on every file served here repeats the sandbox
//     (so the file is sandboxed even if something opens it outside the frame),
//     forbids fetch, XHR and websockets outright, and limits scripts, styles
//     and images to the plugin's own folder and the SDK;
//   - Guard refuses any request to the Wails runtime that comes from an opaque
//     origin, which is what a sandboxed frame's requests carry.
//
// A custom view can still read every kind it declares and, if it navigates
// itself somewhere else, send what it read there. That is the honest limit of
// running someone's code, and why the kinds are declared up front and shown in
// Settings.
