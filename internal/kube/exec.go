package kube

// Opening a shell in a container.
//
// An exec is not a request that returns an answer: it is a request that turns
// into a pair of streams and stays open until one end hangs up. That shape is
// why it lives here rather than beside the one-shot actions -- what it needs
// from a cluster is not a client but the connection under one, because the
// dialer that upgrades the request carries the credentials, the TLS and the
// proxy settings, and none of those can be recovered from a built client.
//
// Two things are worth knowing about what is below:
//
//   - The shell is chosen by trying. A container knows what it has; we do not,
//     and a container image is free to have bash, only sh, or neither. So the
//     candidates are attempted in order and a "no such executable" is taken as
//     "try the next one" rather than as the end of it.
//   - Websocket first, SPDY second. Modern API servers speak the websocket
//     protocol; SPDY is what everything before 1.29 speaks, and some proxies in
//     between will only pass one of the two. client-go's fallback executor
//     tries the first and quietly uses the second when the upgrade is refused,
//     which is what kubectl itself does.

// ---- handing the user's typing to the attempt that is live -----------------
//
// Trying a second shell after the first turns out not to be in the image is
// only safe if the first one lets go of the keyboard on its way out, and it
// does not: client-go copies stdin on a goroutine of its own, which sits
// blocked in Read on whatever reader it was given. A failed attempt leaves that
// goroutine there, and the *next* thing the user types is delivered to it --
// read from the shared reader, written to a closed stream, and gone. The shell
// on screen sees nothing and appears to have hung.
//
// So neither the reader nor the size channel is handed to an attempt directly.
// One pump owns each, and delivers to whichever attempt is currently live;
// ending an attempt closes its end, which unblocks its copier for good.

// stdinCarry is the most that is held for an attempt that has not started yet.
