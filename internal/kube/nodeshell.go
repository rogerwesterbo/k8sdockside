package kube

// A terminal on a node.
//
// There is no such thing as an exec against a node: the API server can reach
// what the kubelet runs, and the machine underneath it is not one of those
// things. So a shell on a node is a shell in a pod that has been given enough
// of the host to be indistinguishable from one -- the node's own PID, network
// and IPC namespaces, its filesystem mounted at /host, and a chroot into it.
// That is what `kubectl debug node/x` does, and this does the same, because
// anything else would be a different answer to "what am I looking at".
//
// It creates something in the cluster, which nothing else in this app does
// without being asked twice. Two things follow from that:
//
//   - The pod is deleted when the terminal closes, whatever closed it.
//   - It carries a deadline as well, so that a pod orphaned by the app being
//     killed does not sit privileged on a node until somebody notices.
