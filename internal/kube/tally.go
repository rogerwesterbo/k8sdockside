// Counting objects by one of their own fields, which is what a solution
// plugin's overview is made of: 42 Applications, 38 of them Healthy.
//
// It is a one-shot list rather than a watch. An overview is a page you open and
// read, not a table you sit in front of, and holding an informer open per card
// would mean a plugin's landing page quietly costing more than the tab it
// links to.

// FieldPath addresses one value inside an object, in the two shapes a
// Kubernetes status is actually written in:
//
//	status.health.status          a plain dotted path
//	status.conditions[Ready]      the status of the condition of that type
//
// The second form exists because conditions are the near-universal Kubernetes
// idiom and a dotted path cannot reach into a list. It is deliberately not a
// general query language: a plugin file comes from outside the app, and "an
// address" is a much smaller thing to accept than "an expression".
