// Package helmcli runs the helm command line on behalf of the app.
//
// Reading a release needs nothing from helm: the record is a Secret, and
// internal/kube/helmdetail.go decodes it. Changing one is a different matter.
// An upgrade fetches a chart from a repository or a registry, renders its
// templates, and three-way merges the result against what is in the cluster;
// a rollback and an uninstall have to run the chart's hooks and keep the
// release history straight. That is Helm's job, and the alternative to asking
// helm to do it is either reimplementing it -- with the user's releases as the
// thing that breaks when the reimplementation is wrong -- or linking Helm's own
// library, which brings an OCI registry client, a container image stack and
// some two hundred modules into a binary that otherwise needs none of it.
//
// So: helm is asked. It is not required. A machine without it keeps everything
// in the drawer and loses the four buttons, which is said plainly rather than
// left to fail at the click.
