# Development

Building, testing and releasing k8sdockside. For how it talks to a cluster, see
[architecture.md](architecture.md).

## Requirements

- Go 1.27+ and Node 20+
- The [Wails v3 CLI](https://v3.wails.io/getting-started/installation/), at the
  version this module depends on:
  ```sh
  make install-wails
  ```
- **Linux:** GTK 4 and WebKitGTK 6 development packages. Without them neither
  the app nor the `wails3` CLI will compile:
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S gtk4 webkitgtk-6.0`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libwebkitgtk-6.0-dev`
- **macOS:** Xcode command line tools.
- **Windows:** a C toolchain (the Go MSVC/mingw setup Wails documents), and
  NSIS if you want to build the installer.

## Everyday targets

```sh
make dev             # hot-reloading desktop app
make build           # production desktop build into bin/
make build-go        # compile the Go packages only, no frontend bundle
make test            # Go unit tests with a coverage report
make test-frontend   # Svelte tests (vitest)
make lint            # golangci-lint
make lint-frontend   # svelte-check
make audit           # gosec + govulncheck + npm audit
make help            # every target
```

There is also a headless mode that runs the app as a plain HTTP server with no
native GUI dependencies, which is handy for poking at the backend:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags server -o bin/k8sdockside-server .
WAILS_SERVER_PORT=9741 ./bin/k8sdockside-server
```

## Tests

### The frontend tests

`make test-frontend` runs two vitest projects. Application state (`*.test.ts`)
runs in jsdom with the Wails bindings mocked — it is plain logic over runes and
does not need a browser. Components (`*.browser.test.ts`) run in headless
Chromium through Playwright, because `$effect`, focus and pointer handling only
behave as they do in the app when there is a real browser under them.

The browser project needs Chromium once:

```sh
cd frontend && npx playwright install chromium
```

### Running the Go tests against a real cluster

Most of the package is tested against literals. The live tests are opt-in,
because they need a cluster, and skip silently without the environment:

```sh
K8SDOCKSIDE_TEST_KUBECONFIG=~/kubeconfig/example.config \
K8SDOCKSIDE_TEST_CONTEXT=admin@example \
  go test ./internal/kube/ -run Live -v
```

The exec and port-forward checks need something to open, and skip without it.
Both go through a protocol upgrade that no unit test can stand in for:

```sh
K8SDOCKSIDE_TEST_KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config \
K8SDOCKSIDE_TEST_CONTEXT=admin@example \
K8SDOCKSIDE_TEST_POD=argocd/argocd-redis-5b965dbf67-wnk4x \
K8SDOCKSIDE_TEST_SERVICE=argocd/argocd-server \
  go test ./internal/kube/ -run Live -v
```

## Continuous integration

| Workflow | Runs on | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | every branch push, and PRs into `main` | Go build, test, vet, gofmt check and golangci-lint; bindings generation, svelte-check, vitest and the frontend bundle; gosec, govulncheck and `npm audit --audit-level=high` |
| [`security.yml`](../.github/workflows/security.yml) | Mondays 03:00 UTC, manual, and dependency changes on `main` | The same Go scanners in reporting mode with SARIF filed under **Security → Code scanning**, a Trivy filesystem scan for secrets and misconfiguration, and a full npm audit |
| [`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) | tags matching `v*`, and manual | Builds and packages every platform, then publishes the GitHub release |

CI only runs the jobs a change can affect, via `dorny/paths-filter`. Note that
the frontend filter includes `**/*.go`: `frontend/bindings/` is generated from
the Go services and is not committed, so a service signature change breaks the
frontend without touching a file under `frontend/`.

The toolchain setup is shared by all three workflows in
[`.github/actions/setup-build`](../.github/actions/setup-build/action.yml),
which installs the Linux GUI headers, Go from `go.mod`, Node, and the `wails3`
CLI pinned to the version `go.mod` requires. Pinning matters: a CLI newer than
the library generates bindings the app cannot compile against.

## Cutting a release

Releases are driven entirely by the tag. Either route works and both run
[`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) exactly once — publishing a
release on the website creates the tag, which fires the same push event.

**From git:**

```sh
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**From github.com:** *Releases → Draft a new release*, create the tag `v1.2.3`
against `main`, write whatever notes you want and publish. The workflow fills in
the assets and appends the install instructions to your notes.

Tags must be `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with an optional pre-release suffix. A suffix
(`v1.2.3-rc.1`) marks the GitHub release as a pre-release, and is stripped from
the version stamped into the packaging metadata, because NSIS and
`CFBundleVersion` accept dotted numbers only.

`workflow_dispatch` rebuilds an existing tag, for when a release job failed on
something outside the code.

### What a release produces

| Platform | Assets |
|---|---|
| Linux (amd64, arm64) | `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.pkg.tar.zst`, and a `.tar.gz` of the bare binary |
| macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon) | `.dmg`, and a `.zip` of the `.app` bundle |
| Windows (amd64) | NSIS `-installer.exe`, and a `.zip` of the bare `.exe` |
| All | `checksums.txt`, its cosign signature (`.sig` + `.pem`), and an SPDX SBOM |

Both macOS architectures build on the Apple Silicon runner: the macOS SDK is
universal and clang cross-targets `x86_64` natively, which is what Wails' own
`darwin:build:universal` task relies on. That avoids depending on the Intel
runner images continuing to exist.

### Version stamping

The repository carries a hardcoded `0.0.1` in its packaging metadata.
[`.github/scripts/stamp-version.sh`](../.github/scripts/stamp-version.sh)
rewrites it from the tag in the release job's own checkout, and never commits
the result. It touches `build/config.yml`, `build/windows/info.json`,
`build/windows/nsis/wails_tools.nsh`, `build/darwin/Info.plist`,
`build/linux/nfpm/nfpm.yaml` and `settingsservice.go`.

That last one is the version the *running app* shows — in the About dialog
under the app menu, and in **Settings → About**. It is stamped into the source
rather than injected with `-ldflags -X`, because the Wails build tasks hardcode
their own `-ldflags` and expose no hook to add to them: overriding `BUILD_FLAGS`
on the command line is silently ignored, since Task's task-level `vars` outrank
CLI vars. A build from a working tree leaves it empty and the app reports
"development build".

The full tag reaches the app and the deb/rpm packages, so `v1.2.3-rc.1` reads as
a pre-release. `Info.plist` and NSIS get `1.2.3`, because both accept dotted
numbers only.

Run it locally to see what it does:

```sh
.github/scripts/stamp-version.sh 1.2.3
git diff        # then: git checkout -- build/
```

### Signing

Two different things go by that name, and only one of them is in place.

**Supply-chain signing — done.** The release job signs `checksums.txt` with
cosign using keyless OIDC (no stored key; the certificate names the workflow,
repo and tag), and attests SLSA build provenance for every asset. Verification
commands are in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#verifying-a-download). Both need
`id-token: write`, and provenance also needs `attestations: write` — already
set on the `release` job.

**OS code signing — not done.** Gatekeeper and SmartScreen do not look at
Sigstore, so:

- The macOS `.app` is **ad-hoc** signed. Gatekeeper will refuse it on first
  launch until the user right-clicks → **Open**, or clears the quarantine
  attribute. Proper signing needs an Apple Developer ID and notarisation
  credentials; the Wails scaffold already has `darwin:sign` and
  `darwin:sign:notarize` tasks waiting for them.
- The Windows installer is **unsigned**, so SmartScreen warns once. An
  Authenticode certificate would plug into the existing `windows:sign` and
  `windows:sign:installer` tasks.
- Linux packages are **unsigned**. `linux:sign:packages` signs the `.deb` and
  `.rpm` with a PGP key.

Wiring any of these up means adding the credentials as repository secrets and
calling the matching task in `release.yml`. They are paid and identity-bound,
which is the only reason they are not already there.
