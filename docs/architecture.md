# Architecture

How k8sdockside talks to a cluster, and why it is built the way it is. For
building and running the app, see [development.md](development.md).

## How the cluster data gets here

Resource listings are **live and watched**, not polled. Opening a tab starts a
`client-go` informer against the cluster; the backend pushes the whole current
table to the frontend whenever anything changes, so a rollout repaints as it
happens and nothing has a refresh button.

- **Everything goes through the dynamic client.** Built-in kinds, the Gateway
  API and arbitrary CRDs are all `unstructured` objects on one code path, which
  is what lets a custom resource open in a tab without anything being compiled
  in for it.
- **One watch per kind per context**, shared by every tab looking at it, closed
  when the last of them does. The namespace filter is applied to the informer's
  cache, so changing it repaints without reopening anything.
- **Columns are data.** Most are JSONPath expressions; the few that are computed
  rather than read (a pod's ready count, a workload's condition) have a Go
  function instead. Custom resources supply their own columns from the CRD's
  `additionalPrinterColumns` — the same source `kubectl get` uses, so the
  tables match the command line.
- **Secrets are redacted before they are cached.** An informer holds the whole
  collection in memory; the tables only ever show how many keys a secret has, so
  the values are dropped on the way in. The editor is the exception, and has to
  be: it reads the object live rather than from the cache, because an editor
  that opened on a redacted copy would save the redaction back over the secret.
- **Editing is a read, a `PUT` and nothing clever.** The document keeps its
  `resourceVersion`, so a save while a controller (or another person) has moved
  the object on is refused as a conflict rather than silently winning it. What
  comes back from the save is what the editor then holds — with the new
  version, and whatever defaulting and admission control did on the way in —
  so a second save is not arguing with an object that no longer exists.
  Changing `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` or `metadata.namespace` is
  refused: the write goes to the URL of the object that was opened, so a rename
  there cannot mean what it looks like it means.
- **A shell and a forward are streams, not requests.** Both upgrade one HTTP
  request into a connection that stays open — over websockets where the API
  server speaks them, over SPDY where it or something in between does not, which
  is the same pair `kubectl` falls back through. Both ride the connection a tab
  already has. A shell tries each configured shell in turn and takes "no such
  executable" as "try the next one"; while it is doing that, what you type is
  held for whichever attempt is live, because a failed attempt's copier would
  otherwise still be holding the keyboard.
- **Node and dashboard figures are capacity and requests, not usage.** Live
  usage comes from the metrics API, a separate server that is not always
  installed.

Credentials come from `clientcmd`, so client certificates, tokens and `exec`
plugins all work. Note that the kubeconfig is read twice by design: the parser
in [`internal/kube/config.go`](../internal/kube/config.go) reads the little
needed to *list* contexts and is forgiving of files it cannot fully understand,
while `clientcmd` reads what is needed to *connect*.

## The generated bindings

`frontend/bindings/` is produced by `wails3 generate bindings` (`make
generate`). It is build output rather than source: it is gitignored, and CI
generates it before anything under `frontend/` is type-checked, tested or
bundled. Rerun it after changing a service's methods or any type they mention.

Two things about the generated types are worth knowing, and both are handled in
one place — `frontend/src/lib/state/adopt.ts`, which every service result passes
through on its way into the app:

- Every Go slice and map is typed as nullable, because a nil one serialises to
  JSON `null`.
- Depending on the generator flags, models arrive as *classes* rather than plain
  objects, and Svelte's `$state` does not deep-proxy class instances — so a
  nested write to one would never reach the UI.

`make generate` and the binding step inside `wails3 build` must be given the
same flags, or each will quietly undo the other's output.

## Where settings live

`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k8sdockside/settings.json`, falling back to
`~/.config/k8sdockside/settings.json`, on both macOS and Linux; Windows uses
`%AppData%`. The path is shown in the status bar. Themes and plugins you install
go in `themes/` and `plugins/` folders beside it — see [themes.md](themes.md)
and [plugins.md](plugins.md).

Releases up to and including the ones that used `os.UserConfigDir` wrote to
`~/Library/Application Support/k8sdockside/` on macOS. That file is moved to the
new location automatically on first launch, unless one is already there.
