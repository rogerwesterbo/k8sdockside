// ThemeService is how the frontend gets its colours: the themes that ship with
// the app, the ones the user has installed, and the folders they are read from.
//
// The reading happens here rather than in the webview because a theme is a file
// on disk, and the frontend has no business knowing where a user's config lives
// or being handed a path to open. It also means the built-in themes and a
// stranger's downloaded one go through exactly one parser and one validator --
// see internal/themes.
//
// Like SettingsService, every mutator answers with the whole catalogue, so the
// frontend replaces its state with what actually happened rather than assuming
// its optimistic update stuck.
