// HelmService serves Helm releases: the tab that lists them, and the drawer
// that opens one.
//
// Helm being its own service rather than a corner of ResourceService is the
// point rather than an accident. A release is not a Kubernetes kind: it is a
// Secret with a gzipped JSON payload, so nothing here can be watched, nothing
// here resolves through the REST mapper, and the interesting half of that
// payload is exactly the half the resource cache refuses to hold. Those are
// three exceptions to how every other view in the app works, and they are
// better stated once, here, than threaded as special cases through the
// machinery that serves real kinds.
//
// It shares a watcher with ResourceService, and so a client pool: a context
// already open in a tab costs no second connection and no second credential
// exec when its releases are read.
//
// The two halves of it are not symmetric, and that asymmetry is the design.
// Reading needs nothing installed: the record is decoded here. Changing a
// release is Helm's own operation -- fetching a chart, rendering it, three-way
// merging it, running its hooks -- and is done by running helm, which the user
// may not have. So the reads always work and the writes say plainly when they
// cannot. See internal/helmcli.
