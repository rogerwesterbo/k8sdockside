// What has been written, per object.
//
// An object can be on screen in more than one place at once -- the describe
// panel and an editor in the dock -- and only one of those places is the one
// doing the writing. Rather than have the writer know who else is looking, it
// says only that an object changed; whoever is showing that object notices and
// re-reads.
//
// A revision rather than a callback because the readers are Svelte components:
// reading `revision(ref)` inside an effect is the subscription, and there is
// nothing to unregister when the component goes.
//
// This is about our own writes. Changes made elsewhere -- kubectl, a controller
// -- do not pass through here; catching those means watching the object in the
// backend, which is a larger thing than this.
