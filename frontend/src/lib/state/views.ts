// What each resource tab was showing when it was last on screen: its sort, its
// namespace filter and its search.
//
// The pane wraps the active view in {#key tab.id}, so bringing another tab
// forward destroys the table and coming back builds a new one, which would
// otherwise land on the default order, every namespace and an empty search --
// and pods sorted by age is exactly the view somebody leaves for a moment and
// expects to find again. So a table writes what it is showing here as it
// changes, and reads it back as it mounts.
//
// Kept for the session and no longer. A closed tab takes its view with it, the
// way it takes an editor's buffer: a search left in a tab closed this morning
// is not the search wanted from the one opened this afternoon, and hiding rows
// behind a filter nobody remembers typing would be the worse surprise. Not
// written to disk either: a sort is a column index, and a settings file older
// than a change to a kind's columns would sort by the wrong one.
