// after that tab is closed, after the context is deselected, and -- as a row
// waiting to be reconnected -- after the app itself is restarted.
//
// The backend owns the truth. Everything here either asks it a question or
// listens to what it says: a forward's state changes when a listener comes up,
// when a pod behind it goes away, and when a connection drops hours later, and
// none of those are things this side could work out for itself.
