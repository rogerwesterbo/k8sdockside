// Where a view sits, and what a view is.
//
// The app used to have two kinds of tab: a strip along the top holding resource
// kinds, and a dock at the foot holding documents. They did the same things --
// opened, closed, reordered, restored -- through two parallel sets of code, and
// each was nailed to its own end of the window. A YAML editor could only ever
// be at the bottom, a pod list could only ever be in the middle.
//
// This is the one model both became. A tab names what it shows; a pane is a
// place tabs go; and which pane a tab is in is the user's to decide, not the
// view type's. Everything that used to be "the dock" is now the bottom pane,
// which is a pane like the others that happens to start out holding documents.
//
// Nothing here touches Svelte state or the backend: it is the vocabulary the
// store is written in, so it can be reasoned about -- and tested -- on its own.

/**
 * The places a tab can be.
 *
 * Four fixed containers rather than a tree of splits. That is a deliberate
 * ceiling: it covers what people actually reach for -- the cluster tree down
 * one side, a list in the middle, its logs under it, an editor beside it --
 * while keeping the layout a flat record that can be written to the settings
 * file and read back without a migration every time the shape grows a case.
 *
 * Left and right are hidden outright when they hold nothing; the bottom one
 * keeps its strip, because a place has to be visible before anything can be
 * dragged into it.
