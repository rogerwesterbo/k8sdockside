// the tab closing that discards a draft, because that is the only action that
// says so.

// Nothing here knows about the workspace store. A document needs the four
// fields that name an object and nothing else, which is what keeps this
// testable without a window, a tab strip or a cluster. The change signal is no
// exception: it is a leaf that names objects the same way, and saying an object
// changed is not the same as knowing who is looking at it.
