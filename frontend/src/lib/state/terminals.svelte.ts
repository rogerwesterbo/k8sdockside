// One per dock tab, keyed by the tab's id and outliving the component that
// renders it -- the same arrangement the logs and editors stores use, and here
// it is not merely convenient but required: switching dock tabs destroys the
// component, and a shell is a *conversation*. A half-typed command, a directory
// you have cd'd into, an editor you have open in it -- none of that could be
// rebuilt by reopening, because none of it is anywhere but in the shell itself.
//
// So the xterm instance lives here, and the component only borrows it: on mount
// it asks for the terminal and attaches it to its own element, and on destroy
// it lets go without closing anything.
