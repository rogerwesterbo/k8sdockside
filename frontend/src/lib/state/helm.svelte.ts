// is the release's own record rather than a describe report -- a release has no
// Kubernetes kind for the describe path to resolve, and asking it to try is
// where "unknown resource kind: helmreleases" came from.
//
// Like the other stores here, it knows nothing about the workspace: it is handed
// the three fields that name a release, and whoever asked owns telling the user
// how it went.
