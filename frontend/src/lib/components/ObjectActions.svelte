<!--
  The bar of things you can do to the object the panel is describing.

  Which buttons appear is the catalogue's answer (../actions.ts) and what they
  do is the store's (../state/actions.svelte.ts). What is here is the middle:
  asking before the two that cannot be undone, holding the replica count while
  it is typed, and showing a drain as it works.

  A question replaces the bar rather than opening a dialog over it, so that
  "Delete web?" is read in the same place the button was pressed and cannot be
  mistaken for a question about something else.
