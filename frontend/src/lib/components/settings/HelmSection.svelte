<!--
  Where helm is, and how it is run.

  This section exists because of one specific thing, and the rest follows from
  it: reading a Helm release needs nothing installed -- a release is a Secret,
  and the app decodes it -- while changing one is Helm's own operation and is
  done by running helm. So the drawer always works and four buttons depend on a
  binary that may not be there.

  On macOS it usually is there and the app still cannot see it: an app launched
  from Finder inherits a PATH of four system directories, and Homebrew is on
  none of them. That is not something anything can repair on the user's behalf,
  so it is asked -- with the answer to `which helm` shown as soon as one is
  found, so it is clear which helm is being used.
