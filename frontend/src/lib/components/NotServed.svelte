<!--
  What a view shows when the cluster does not serve its kind at all.

  Not an error, and deliberately not drawn as one: the Gateway API, the newer
  admission policies and every CRD are optional, and a cluster without them is
  healthy. A red alert and "something went wrong" would send the reader looking
  for a fault that is not there. So this says plainly that the API is not
  installed, how to install it where there is a known answer, and offers a
  second look for the reader who has just done that.
