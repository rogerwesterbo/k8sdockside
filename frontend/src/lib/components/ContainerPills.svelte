<!--
  A pod's containers, one small rectangle each.

  The colour is the state and the count is the number of rectangles, so a screen
  of pods can be scanned instead of read. Colour is never the only carrier: each
  rectangle names its container and says its state in words, which is what a
  tooltip shows and what a screen reader reads out.

  The same row of rectangles serves two places. In the table it is a picture,
  and a click on it belongs to the row underneath. In the detail panel it is the
  container picker for the log view, and each rectangle is a button.
