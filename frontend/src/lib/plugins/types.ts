// What a solution plugin is, as the app works with it.
//
// A plugin teaches k8sdockside about something installed in a cluster -- Argo
// CD, Flux, Prometheus -- and gives it a place of its own in the sidebar. Like
// a theme it is a JSON file and nothing else: it names kinds the app already
// knows how to list and says how to arrange and summarise them, so installing
// someone else's is as safe as installing their theme.
//
// The one distinction worth holding on to is that a plugin is installed on
// *this machine*, while the solution it describes is installed in a *cluster*.
// Those come apart constantly, and everything below that talks about "detected"
// or "installed" is about the second.
