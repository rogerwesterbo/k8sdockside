// Opening a page outside the app.
//
// A plain `<a target="_blank">` does nothing here. The window is a WKWebView
// (WebView2 on Windows), and asking one for a new window only works if the host
// implements the delegate that makes one; Wails does not, so the click lands on
// nothing at all -- no new window, no error, no sign that anything happened.
// Dropping the target would be worse: the webview would then navigate *itself*
// to the page, replacing the app with a website and no way back.
//
// So every link out goes through the runtime instead, which hands the address
// to the machine's own browser. The anchors keep their href and their target:
// the href is what the address is, and the inert target is what makes a click
// this module somehow misses do nothing rather than something bad.
