// The application state is plain logic over runes and is fastest in jsdom with
// the Wails bindings mocked. Components are not: `$effect` and the runes
// runtime only behave as they do in the app when there is a real browser under
// them, and the tab menu is almost entirely effects, focus and pointer events.
